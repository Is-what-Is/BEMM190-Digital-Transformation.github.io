        <article class="content">
            <p>As a data consultant in a supply chain and applied data science consultancy, where one of our main capabilities is digital transformation, I have found this module particularly useful and reflective.</p>

            <p>The content in week one made me evaluate what digital transformation is and isn’t. Implementing digital transformation should always be focused on the aspects of the organisation which generate value, accompanied by cultural and procedural change. This was the most important theme I expressed in week one’s discussion, along with the ability to understand where in the hype cycle of new technology you are situated. From my experience, most organisations are not ready for advanced analytics like machine learning and are currently scrambling for data engineers and architects to sort out their data so as not to miss this AI wave.</p>

            <p>The theme in week two’s content that resonated with me was, of course, Max Tegmark’s Life 3.0 technological evolution theory. It was somewhat scary and exhilarating to think about what my foreseeable life is going to look like as we experience a technological revolution or evolution. As much as I wanted to indulge in the science utopia or dystopia, the more relevant topic was the everything-as-a-service tech model. The company I work for subscribes to this and primarily relies on the Microsoft platform to implement our solutions.</p>

            <p>Having previously studied Economics in my undergraduate degree, I found the analysis and argument for data being considered very interesting and compelling in week three’s content. I found the contribution and discussion around data ethics very revealing, and my research into Google’s Project Nightingale made me thankful that I don’t live in the US and that we have GDPR to protect us. However, the most important topic for me was data maturity assessments, as this is something my company regularly performs as a starting point for many projects.</p>
