            <h1>BEMM190: DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION</h1>
            <h2>PORTFOLIO PART 6: A REVIEW OF LEARNING</h2>
        </section>

        <article class="content">
    <p class="intro">As a data consultant in a supply chain and applied data science consultancy—where one of our core capabilities is digital transformation—this module has proven to be particularly insightful and reflective.</p>

<div class="week-wrapper">
    <div class="week-section">
        <h3>Week 1: What Digital Transformation Really Means</h3>
        <p>The content in week one challenged me to rethink what digital transformation is—and what it isn’t. It became clear that true digital transformation should focus on the areas of an organisation that generate the most value and must be underpinned by both cultural and procedural change. This was the central theme of my week one discussion. I also highlighted the importance of understanding where a new technology sits within the hype cycle. In my experience, many organisations aren’t ready for advanced analytics or machine learning. Instead, they’re scrambling to hire data engineers and architects to organise their data in fear of missing the current AI wave.</p>
    </div>



    <div class="week-section">
        <h3>Week 2: Life 3.0 and Everything-as-a-Service</h3>
        <p>Week two’s standout theme for me was Max Tegmark’s <em>Life 3.0</em> and its theory of technological evolution. It was both exhilarating and unsettling to consider what my life could look like amid this ongoing revolution. While it was tempting to explore the utopian or dystopian futures presented in the reading, the more grounded takeaway for me was the rise of the "everything-as-a-service" model. It’s highly relevant to my current role, where we primarily rely on the Microsoft platform to deliver our solutions.</p>
    </div>

            

    <div class="week-section">
        <h3>Week 3: Data as an Asset & Ethical Awareness</h3>
        <p>Having previously studied Economics in my undergraduate degree, I found the argument around data being considered a form of capital really interesting. Week three also sparked important ethical reflections—my research into Google’s Project Nightingale was eye-opening, and it made me appreciate the protections GDPR and public health care offers in the UK. However, the most valuable aspect of the week for me was learning more about data maturity assessments, given that they’re a critical first step in many of my client engagements.</p>
    </div>



    <div class="week-section">
        <h3>Week 4: Digital Drivers</h3>
        <p>In week four, we explored the key digital drivers of transformation. The driver that prompted discussion was the Internet of Things (IoT) and its role in revolutionising agriculture—a critical issue as we confront the challenges of climate change. However, in the end-of-week discussion, I expressed how quantum computing is likely to become a very important driver and disrupter of transformation by the end of the decade.</p>
    </div>



    <div class="week-section">
        <h3>Week 5: Understanding the Platform Economy</h3>
        <p>In week five, we delved into the platform economy, and I fully grasped why the platform economy became so lucrative. As expressed in my end-of-week discussion, it is because platforms create ecosystems which facilitate additional market interactions, of which the platform gains a slice. Furthermore, the discussion raised ethical concerns surrounding the political power these platforms wield and how much governments should interfere in regulating them.</p>
    </div>



    <div class="week-section">
        <h3>Week 6 & 7: Organisational Culture and Agile Mindsets</h3>
        <p>In weeks 6 & 7, we explored the role of organisational culture, particularly around the paradigm of Agile. Out of all the topics we covered, I found this to be the most important and relevant to me. As mentioned in the discussions, I have undertaken a Scrum certification, and it was a useful reminder of how important the agile culture is, as well as implementing the specific framework’s practical procedures. It made me reflect on a current project I’m involved in, which had lost sight of its intended Agile structure. After raising this with my project manager, we agreed on the need to steer back towards an Agile mindset. This experience reinforced for me how crucial it is for organisations to embed a culture that supports—not hinders—transformation.</p>
    </div>



    <div class="week-section">
        <h3>Week 8: Delivering Digital Change</h3>
        <p>Building on the Agile theme, week eight examined how successful digital change is the result of a combination of factors: Agile culture, aspirational strategy, fast action, assessments, and the right organisational structure. As presented in my weekly discussion, I found John Kotter’s (1996) ideas resonated with me and they made me reflect upon my company’s organisational structure. Though effective—I think it may be too hierarchical for a fast-growing consultancy. Our competitive edge lies in agility, and we must guard against rigid hierarchies that could stifle decision-making and innovation.</p>
    </div>



    <div class="week-section">
        <h3>Week 9: Looking Ahead in a Shifting Job Market</h3>
        <p>Although I’m already fortunate to be employed in a dynamic sector, week nine’s focus on navigating an evolving job market prompted me to reflect on my career path. Right now, my work centres on data analytics, but I’m keen to move into more data-rich industries and deepen my expertise in advanced analytics. Ultimately, my ambition is to transition into a data strategist role, where I can shape how organisations use data to drive transformation.</p>
    </div>
</div>


        <p class="intro">Overall, I have enjoyed learning and participating in the weekly content and discussions. Being able to utilise Gen-AI tools has been extremely helpful, allowing me to summarise the suggested reading and process vast amounts of information quickly. It has also increased the volume and quality of work I was able to produce in my portfolio, whether it was helping with references, prompting thought-provoking ideas, or understanding complex ideas.</p>
        <p class="intro">Looking back at my digital assessment from the start of the module, it’s clear I’ve picked up valuable new skills—particularly in areas like graphic design. The weekly discussions have also boosted my confidence in sharing ideas and engaging with others, something I now intend to carry forward on platforms like LinkedIn, Kaggle, and Stack Overflow.</p>
