    <p class="intro">As a data consultant in a supply chain and applied data science consultancy—where one of our core capabilities is digital transformation—this module has proven to be particularly insightful and reflective.</p>

        <h3>Week 1: What Digital Transformation Really Means</h3>
        <p>The content in week one challenged me to rethink what digital transformation is—and what it isn’t. It became clear that true digital transformation should focus on the areas of an organisation that generate the most value and must be underpinned by both cultural and procedural change. This was the central theme of my week one discussion. I also highlighted the importance of understanding where a new technology sits within the hype cycle. In my experience, many organisations aren’t ready for advanced analytics or machine learning. Instead, they’re scrambling to hire data engineers and architects to organise their data in fear of missing the current AI wave.</p>

        <h3>Week 2: Life 3.0 and Everything-as-a-Service</h3>
        <p>Week two’s standout theme for me was Max Tegmark’s <em>Life 3.0</em> and its theory of technological evolution. It was both exhilarating and unsettling to consider what my life could look like amid this ongoing revolution. While it was tempting to explore the utopian or dystopian futures presented in the reading, the more grounded takeaway for me was the rise of the "everything-as-a-service" model. It’s highly relevant to my current role, where we rely heavily on the Microsoft platform to deliver solutions within this framework.</p>

        <h3>Week 3: Data as an Asset & Ethical Awareness</h3>
        <p>Having previously studied Economics in my undergraduate degree, I found the discussion around data as an asset class especially engaging. Week three also sparked important ethical reflections—my research into Google’s Project Nightingale was eye-opening, and it made me appreciate the protections GDPR offers in the UK. Data maturity assessments stood out as a key learning point, given that they’re a critical first step in many of our client engagements.</p>
